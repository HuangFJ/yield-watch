[2018-9-27] This code is **deprecated** because The coinmarketcap api has changed.

This is my weekend project. It's much experiential. I make this project for studying Rust language.
Rust is much more like Haskell which I used before and inspired me a lot. However, Haskell is not 
so easy, it has many concepts like functional, lazy evaluation and monad. Rust has similar things
but more comprehensive and well performed. It's fast and safe. The highlight of Rust, I think, is 
no gc, benefit from it's ownership, borrowing and lifetime. All you need to do is spending time to 
figure out what they are and practicing with them.

I'm a fan of blockchain. I remained concerned about it almost everyday. I had help nimiq and akasha 
to translate docs and dapps. As an engineer, I was enjoy these things. Until I found there are no
good tools to help me caculate the cryptocurrencies or coins' amount and marcket value. So I
develop this. I hope you guys will like it when it launch after a couple of weeks.
